									First you need to install a powerful code editor{" "}
									<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">
										VS Code
									</a>{" "}
									(Visual Studio Code).{" "}
									<More>
										VS Code is also built with web technologies, which means
										that it can literally run in the browser (with some features
										not available).
									</More>
									<br />
									It has clear installation instructions on its homepage, just
									follow it according to your system setup.
								</p>
								<p>
									VS Code has a large community and thousands of extensions
									including different beautiful themes. Press{" "}
									<InlineCode>Cmd + K</InlineCode> then{" "}
									<InlineCode>Cmd + T</InlineCode> (Use Ctrl instead of Cmd on
									Windows).
								</p>
								<p>
									You can go browse some additional themes and choose your
									favourite one. Some popular options are Dracula, One Dark Pro,
									Community Material Theme, etc. My choice is{" "}
									<a href="https://catppuccin.com/" target="_blank">
										Catppuccin Mocha

								<h1>Install Node.js</h1>
								<p>
									Just follow the instructions on its homepage. Remember to
									install the latest version (19.7.0).
								</p>
								<p>
									After you installed it, open a new terminal and type{" "}
									<InlineCode>node -v</InlineCode>
									and enter. You should see your Node.js' version then.
								</p>
								<h2>"How do I get a terminal?"</h2>
								<p>
									VS Code just has a easy way to open and manage terminals! In the
									menu bar, you will see a Terminal bar, which contains the item
									"New Terminal".
								</p>
								<img src={VSCodeTerminalImg}></img>
								<p>
									Then, run <InlineCode>corepack enable</InlineCode> in your
									terminal. This enables us to use{" "}
									<a href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</a> (Performant Node.js Package
									Manager). It's an alternative to{" "}
									<a href="https://npm.im/">npm</a> (Node Package Manager). It's
									much faster and it can save a lot of disk space than npm with
									the full functionality of npm.
									<br />
									After running <InlineCode>corepack enable</InlineCode>, type{" "}
									<InlineCode>pnpm -v</InlineCode>, you should see your pnpm's

							<h1>HTML, CSS, JS</h1>
							<p>
								To build a web page, you'll need to know three different languages:
								HTML, CSS, JS.
							</p>
							<p>
								{" "}
								What is the connection between these three languages?
								<br /> HTML describes the <b>content</b> of the page, CSS adds{" "}

							<h1>HTML</h1>
							<p>
								HyperText Markup Language (who cares its full name) looks something
								like this:
							</p>
							<Code id="chapter0/src/routes/+page.svelte"></Code>
							And the code above will show this in the browser:
							<img src={HTMLExampleResult}></img>
							<h2>Wait, where do I put the code?</h2>
							<p>
								We are gonna use a framework called{" "}
								<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> to build our example
								website. It uses `.svelte` files with the Svelte syntax, which you
								can just write HTML, CSS and JS in.
							</p>
							<p>
								To create a new SvelteKit project, go to your terminal again, and go
								to your home directory (use{" "}
								<code class="inline">
									cd {"<"}directory{">"}
								</code>{" "}
								to change your current directory, on Mac, you can go to your home
								directory by typing <InlineCode>cd ~</InlineCode>), type
								<InlineCode>pnpm create svelte chapter0</InlineCode>. Choose the
								option "Skeleton project" as the Svelte app template, the option
								"Yes, using TypeScript syntax" for the "Add type checking with
								TypeScript?". No additional options are needed for now. Then, in VS
								Code, open that directory (it should be the `chapter0` at your home
								directory). If you did it correctly, you should see a view like
								this:
							</p>
							<img src={CreateSvelteImg} />
							<img src={SvelteKitProjectResultImg} />
							<p>
								Then, create a new terminal, run{" "}
								<InlineCode>pnpm install</InlineCode>. After the command is run, you
								should see a new directory `node_modules` created.
							</p>
							<img src={SvelteKitInstallImg} />
							<p>
								Open the <InlineCode>src/routes/+page.svelte</InlineCode>, change
								the content to the code provided above. If VS Code asks you to
								install a plugin, just do what VS Code asks you to do.
							</p>
							<img src={ChangePageSvelteImg} />
							<p>
								Then, run <InlineCode>pnpm dev</InlineCode> and open the link shown
								in the terminal.

							<h1>HTML Syntax</h1>
							<p>
								HTML consists of <b>elements</b>. Each element has one <b>tag</b> ,
								multiple <b>attributes</b> and some optional children.
								<br />
								For example,{" "}
								<InlineCode>{"<h1>This is a heading!</h1>"}</InlineCode> is just an
								element. The tag of this element is <InlineCode>h1</InlineCode>,
								while the child of the element is the text{" "}
								<InlineCode>This is a heading!</InlineCode>. This h1 element doesn't
								has any attributes on it.
								<br />
								Another example,{" "}
								<InlineCode>{`<a href="https://ohhwebdev.pages.dev/">OhhWebDev</a>`}</InlineCode>{" "}
								is an element with the tag <InlineCode>a</InlineCode>, an attribute{" "}
								<InlineCode>href</InlineCode> set as{" "}
								<InlineCode>"https://ohhwebdev.pages.dev/"</InlineCode> and a child
								which is the text <InlineCode>OhhWebDev</InlineCode>.
							</p>
							<p>
								To create an new element, start with the open angle bracket{" "}
								<InlineCode>{"<"}</InlineCode>, leading the tag of the element and
								the close angle bracket <InlineCode>{">"}</InlineCode>. Between the
								tag and the close bracket, the attributes are defined. Then after
								the close angle bracket, the children of the element begins. When
								the close tag appears, the children ends and the element is closed.
								The close tag is just <InlineCode>{"</tag-name>"}</InlineCode>. Note
								that HTML is not case-sensitive, which means that{" "}
								<InlineCode>tagName</InlineCode> is the same as{" "}
								<InlineCode>tagname</InlineCode>. Instead of using{" "}
								<InlineCode>camelCase</InlineCode> or
								<InlineCode>snake_case</InlineCode>, HTML uses{" "}
								<InlineCode>kebab-case</InlineCode>, that the words are separated
								with minus signs (<InlineCode>-</InlineCode>).
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>You hate text descriptions?</b> This explains everything:
							</p>
							<Code id="chapter0/src/element.svelte" />
							<h2>"What are some common tags?</h2>
							<p>
								{
									"<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6> are used to present headings. The number in their name is just their heading level.\n"
								}
								<br />
								{"<p> for paragraphs"}
								<br />
								{
									"<a> for hyperlinks, use the href attribute to set the URL the link is to"
								}
								<br />
								{
									"<img> for images, use the src attribute to set the URL of the image"
								}
